    <h3>Hey there, 👋</h3>
    I'm <span>Keval Kankrecha</span>, and I have completed my
    <span>Bachelor of Computer Engineering</span> from Darshan University,
    Rajkot. I am a passionate backend developer with strong experience in
    building scalable and reliable APIs using <span>Node.js</span> and
    <span>NestJS</span>. I have worked with both
    <span>relational (MySQL)</span> and
    <span>non-relational (MongoDB)</span> databases, along with practical
    exposure to <span>RabbitMQ and Redis</span> for handling distributed systems
    and caching.

    <br /><br />

    Beyond backend development, I am deeply interested in Agentic AI. I have
    worked with <span>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</span>,
    GPT-based models, web scraping, and vector databases like
    <span>Qdrant</span> to design intelligent and adaptive AI agents.

    <br /><br />

    Beyond my coding expertise, I am deeply spiritual, following the path of
    <span>Hinduism and Sanatan</span> Dharma, and actively volunteering at
    <span>BAPS</span> for the past few years. I hold a profound admiration for
    <span>Mahakal</span>, finding solace and inspiration in his divine essence.
